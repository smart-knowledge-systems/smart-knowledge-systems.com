# Smart Knowledge Systems Website

This repository contains the source code for the Smart Knowledge Systems business website, built with Next.js and TypeScript. The site showcases my consulting services focused on breaking down information silos in organizations.

## About the Project

Smart Knowledge Systems is my consulting business that helps organizations improve knowledge flow and collaboration. The website includes:

- Detailed descriptions of services offered
- Information about my approach to knowledge sharing
- Resources for potential clients
- Professional background and expertise

## Technical Implementation

This website demonstrates several technical capabilities:

- **Modern React and Next.js** - Built using the App Router and latest Next.js features
- **TypeScript** - Fully typed components and content
- **Tailwind CSS** - Responsive design with Tailwind's utility-first approach
- **Content Management** - Structured content management using TypeScript and Markdown
- **Optimized Assets** - Performance-focused image loading and optimization
- **Responsive Design** - Mobile-first approach that works on all device sizes

## Development

This project uses Next.js with the App Router. To start development:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the site in your browser.

## Architecture

The site follows a content-driven approach where marketing content is stored separately from the presentation components. This makes it easy to update messaging without changing the underlying site structure.

Key directories:
- `/src/content` - Contains marketing copy and site text
- `/src/components` - Reusable UI components
- `/app` - Next.js App Router pages and layouts
