This model works for maybe one% of companies.

The other 99% either get rejected, run themselves into the ground chasing metrics that don't matter, or spend years feeling like failures because they didn't fit the mold.

I watched this happen for years.

Talented people, with great ideas, who felt disqualified before they even started.

Not because their ideas were bad, not because they weren't willing to work.

But because they didn't fit a model that was never designed for them.

One problem is access to opportunity.

The startup world runs on warm introductions.

To me, investors, you need someone to make the introduction.

To get advice from successful founders, you need to already be in the room where those founders spend their time.

The whole system is designed to keep insiders inside and outsiders out.

And this isn't a secret.

The people who run the system say it out loud.

Mark M. Dresen, co-founder of one of the world's most influential venture capital firms, A 16 C, explained it at Y Combinator Startup School.

He said, The way that most of the top end venture capital firms work is basically they'll take you seriously, if you come in introduced by somebody they've worked with before, and they won't take you seriously, if you don't.

He frames this as a test.

He says, if you can't network your way into a VC meeting, you probably can't network your way into hiring your team, or selling the customers.

But here's what that framing hides.

If you grew up connected, if you went to Stanford or Harvard, if you worked at Google or Facebook, you already have the network.

The test is easy for you.

If you didn't, the test is nearly impossible. 40% of venture capital executives and associates attended either Harvard or Stanford.

Two schools, nearly half the industry.

Roughly a quarter of all sea funding in America, goes to founders from Stanford, Harvard, or MIT.

Those three schools represent less than half a percent of American college graduates.

Companies found it solely by women, received 2.3% of venture capital.

That number hasn't meaningfully changed in 30 years.

Black founders receive one% of venture funding.

Black women .27%.

The system isn't broken.

It's working exactly as it was designed.

It just wasn't designed for most people.

There's one program that tried to democratize access.

Why Combinator has an open application?

Anyone can apply.

And it's produced some of the greatest and most important companies of our generation.

But here's the reality.

My combinator's acceptance rate is less than 2%.

That's harder to get into than Stanford or Harvard.

So the one program designed to open the door is harder to get into than the elite universities that already dominate the system.

This is a problem everywhere, but it's especially frustrating here in Utah.

We talk about community here.

We talk about lifting each other up.

We talk about opportunity.

But if access to the best resources requires knowing someone who's already in, then we're not actually extending opportunity to everyone.

We're just saying we are.

Utah has built something special, via great companies, great founders, a culture that values building things.

We punch above our weight.

But lately, we've been playing the same game as everyone else.

Raise money, grow fast, hope for an exit.

We've imported Silicon Valley's model without asking if it actually works for most of the entrepreneurs in this state.

So, here's the question I keep coming back to.

What if we play a different game?

And this is where I get hopeful, because something changed and it changed fast.

The tools available to entrepreneurs today are genuinely transformative.

AI has changed what's possible for small teams and solar fans, solo founders, sorry, in ways that are hard to overstate.

A single person can now do what used to require 20 people.

You can automate operations, generate content, analyze data, handle customer service, build products, ship code, all with the fraction of the resources it took five years ago.

But the research that took six months ago.

If you haven't been playing around with Claude code, open plot, and Codex, you're in danger of being left behind.

These tools change everything.

And fundamentally, it changes the map.

You don't need to raise millions to compete.

You don't need to hire fast and hope the revenue catches up.

You can build something real, profitable, and sustainable from the start.

The old excuses and the old model no longer applies.

But, again, here's the problem.

Most entrepreneurs don't how to use these tools effectively.

They're still following playbooks written for a different era.

And if they're not already connected to the right networks, they have no way to learn from the people who figured it out.

So, we've been working on something.

Silicon Slopes is a 51 c 3 nonprofit.

No one owns this organization.

I wish I did sometimes.

Be a nice exit.

I would have sold this long ago.

Uh, I'm just kidding.

I'm doing Trump right now.

That's not on the screen.

Anybody does that?

It's like, I don't know, you like read something for the 1st time and then it starts commenting on it.

We exist to serve Utah's entrepreneurial community, all of it.

Not just the founders who fit the venture back home.

For the past year, we've been asking ourselves, what would it look like to build something different?

Not an accelerator.

Not in program designed to fundle founders toward investors.

Something that actually serves the 99% of entrepreneurs who don't need venture capital and probably should have risen.

So today, in partnership with Mountain American Credit Union, I'm announcing start school.

Start school is where Utah entrepreneurs come to learn from the best founders in our state's history.

Completely free.

No pitch decks, no demo days, no pressure to raise money you don't need, no giving up money, no giving up equity.

Sorry.

No hidden agenda.

We're not looking to invest in the best companies that come through our door.

In fact, we won't.

We won't take advisory shares.

We have no angle.

We're nonprofit.

Start school exists for one reason. To help Utah entrepreneurs build sustainable businesses.

That's it.

Start school accepts all entrepreneurs who are passionate about learning, committed to Utah's long term success, and eager to be part of the new era of AI powered entrepreneurship.

We don't filter for credentials.

We don't filter for connections.

We don't filter for how good your idea sounds.

We do, however, filter for commitment.

You don't need to know anyone to get in.

You don't need a warm introduction.

You don't need to have gone to the right school or worked at the right company.

You need to show up, do the work, and give as much as you take.

That's it.

And here's what makes this different.

The mentors for Star School come from Founder Circle, our community of the top 100 founders in Utah's history.

Those that are still alive.

These are CEOs and founders who are built companies valued in $100 million or more.

They've navigated the challenges you're facing.

They've made the mistakes you're trying to avoid. And they've agreed to give back by mentoring the next generation.

In any other context, any other ecosystem, access to founders at this level would require connections, introductions, and luck.

At Star School, it requires a willingness to learn.

Here's how it works.

You apply.

If you can prove you're committed and working on something real, you're in.

Once you're in, we match you with a peer group of 46 other entrepreneurs.

You meet with this group weekly.

Start school consistently hosts mentor hours, workshops, guest speaker series, and other meetups to help learn from the most successful entrepreneurs in Utah's history.

You learn how to lead yourself 1st.

Because this read Hastings once told me, if you can't lead yourself, you can't lead others.

You learn how to get revenue.

How to actually sell something, you collect money, a novel idea.

You learn how to use AI to punch above your weight, practical skills, not height.

You learn unit economics, personal finance, and how to grow without giving up control.

And all of the course materials live online in the Silicon Suns community hub, so you can learn your own pace, and revisit lessons whenever you need them.

But, and this is so pretty.

Start school isn't just about what you get.

It's about what you give.

Every participant commits to giving back.

Mentor a fellow coworker member, share what you've learned, alumni events, contribute, a resource to the community hub, help welcome future cohorts.

This is how we build something that lasts.

Not by just taking, but by giving.

I believe you talk and lead the way in showing what entrepreneurship, entrepreneurship looks like, when it's built for humans, not headlines.

We can produce more $10 million companies owned entirely by the people who built them. That $1 billion companies own mostly by investors.

We can prove that profitable, sustainable businesses are worth celebrating.

That's supporting your family and your communities is a success on its own.

That growing slowly and thoughtfully is a legitimate strategy.

We can build an entrepreneurial ecosystem that actually extends access to opportunity to everyone, not just the people who already have access.

So, let me come back to the question I started with.

Who gets to be an entrepreneur?

The old answer was people who know the right people.

People who went to the right schools, people who looked like the founders who came before them.

People who could pass a networking test, designed by insiders or insiders.

The new answer, the answer, start school represents, is anyone who's willing to learn, willing to work, and willing to give as much as they take?

That's the answer you times deserve.

That's the answer I believe in.

And if you ever felt like the startup world wasn't built for you, I want you to know.

You were right.

It wasn't.

But start school is, applications open today, go to silicon soaps.com slash start at school.

If you're passionate about learning, committed to Utah, and ready to embrace this new era of AI powered entrepreneurship apply.

We want you, if you build something, this is very important because a lot of people in this room have built something.

If you made it, a lot of you have made it.

I'm asking you to get back, become a mentor, share what you've learned.

The entrepreneurs coming after you need what you know.

And honestly, you probably needed someone like you when you were starting out.

If you have a services company that can support the next generation of entrepreneurs, we want you.

Official partners at start school commit to giving something real to every entrepreneur in the program, not a discount code, not a free trial that expires before they figure out what they're building, something they can actually use to get their business off the ground and keep it running.

And for everyone in this room, spread the word.

Tell the entrepreneur, your life, who doesn't think they belong.

Tell them the door is now open.

We're not asking permission to do this.

We're not waiting for the startup world to change.

We're building something different right here, right now, in Utah.

Start schools free.

It's open, and it starts today.

Thank you so much.
